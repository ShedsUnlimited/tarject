# Tarject Dependency Injection Framework

Tarject is a Dependency Injection framework developed for Unity to prevent tight coupling between software modules. Designed with a focus on high optimization and code readability, Tarject minimizes the use of reflection in Bind and Injection operations, reducing performance overhead to a minimum.

The framework simplifies dependency management, making your code more flexible, maintainable, and testable. By enabling systems to operate independently, it allows for easy implementation of changes and ensures scalability across projects. Even in large-scale applications, Tarject provides a consistent structure without sacrificing performance, offering developers a user-friendly and efficient API to work with.
